# OdinFirstProject

This is my attempt to recreate the landing webpage found in The Odin Project's page here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

These are the images I had access to:

The idea: 

![image of a whole landing page](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)

![image containing info on fonts and colors for the above webpage](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png)

Let's see how I fare!
